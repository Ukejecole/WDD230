            <p> Hi, my name is Rachel Devolder. I'm a real estate agent who have worked in the industry for more than 18 years. I recently retired from my Job and i have taken interest in exploring the rivers and lakes in Houston. I observed that there
                are no boating/river-rafting companies in this community. This is why i decided to start up a boating company that deals with organizings tours and boat cruise along the rivers and lakes in Houston. I'm hoping to create an online
                presence where tourists and members of this community can be aware of my company and what it does so as to be able to book boating session and tours as a form of relaxation. </p>
